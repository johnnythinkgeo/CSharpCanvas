CSharpCanvas
============

C# implementation of the Html5 Canvas API. This implementation use Cairo and works on .Net and Mono.
It contains a "script parser" that will create an image from javascript instuctions.

This is mostly a conversion of node-canvas from c++ to c#. It does not implement all the canvas API, only the part that I needed.
If the function you need is not implemented, just look at node-canvas code for inspiration and contribute !

As this is mostly a hack made in one hour, this as not been heavily tested.
